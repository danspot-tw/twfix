Taiwan ID Fixer Chrome Extension

To facilitate sane web browsing, this Chrome extension replaces incorrect names for Taiwan with the correct name. Incorrect names include Chinese Taipei and Taiwan, China.

The extension also tries to replace the oh-so-silly flag for Chinese Taipei with the Taiwan flag.

One small step for a better world.
